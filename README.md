# Infrastructure-Classroom-Venue-Management---Smart-Campus

Remember to pull before you push to main!

"The Classroom/Venue Management App aims to streamline the process of managing classroom
and venue assignments, bookings, and maintenance on campus. It features scheduling
integration with academic calendars, a room booking system, and a maintenance issue reporting
tool. Users can view availability through a visual calendar and receive notifications for bookings
and updates. The implementation of push notifications is a stretch goal. The app includes a
user-friendly dashboard for booking and reporting issues, an admin interface for managing
schedules and maintenance, and robust APIs for handling bookings, schedules, maintenance,
notifications, and user management. Secure and scalable infrastructure will ensure data
integrity and reasonable availability, enhancing the efficiency of space utilization on campus." ~brief given
